# Dotfiles

New (and improved?) Dotfiles.

Okay, I'm not really sure that it's *improved*, per se, but it's definitely updated. We'll see how long this one lasts, considering this is now the third time I've completely redone something like this.

## Okay...why?

In short, I wanted some startup stuff for Codespaces, so I needed this repo. Now, I'm finding myself about to wipe my computer again, and really don't want to have to go through all the setup stuff yet again. So naturally, I spent a few hours doing this, so that I don't have to spend a few hours setting things up again...or...something like that.
