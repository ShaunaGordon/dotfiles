# Dotfiles

New (and improved?) Dotfiles.

Okay, I'm not really sure that it's *improved*, per se, but it's definitely updated. We'll see how long this one lasts, considering this is now the third time I've completely redone something like this.

## Okay...why?

In short, I wanted some startup stuff for Codespaces, so I needed this repo (Codespaces is coded to look for a user repo by this name). Now, I'm finding myself about to wipe my computer again, and really don't want to have to go through all the setup stuff yet again. So naturally, I spent a few hours doing this, so that I don't have to spend a few hours setting things up again...or...something like that.

Also, I use both Mac and Linux, and there are subtle differences between the two when setting up, but I want the same basic things pretty much all the time.

## Cool. What's in it?

It's mostly some bits to get me up and running quickly on any given computer.
